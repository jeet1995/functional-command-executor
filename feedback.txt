Hi Abhijeet,

Thanks for your submission, here are a few comments:

1. Good documentation and well commented, clean code.
2. Implementation is functional. good use of combinators and phantom types.
3. Good use of logging library.
4. Your test examples clearly show use of phantom types as well as monadic combinators on command execution.
